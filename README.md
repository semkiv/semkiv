- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrii Semkiv (@semkiv).
- 👀 I’m interested in programming obviously. I'm a professional C++ developer with more than 4 years of commercial experience so C++ has quite long been a major part of my life. But not only that. I try to keep up with everything that happens in the IT and tech world in general. And I love video games and even used to work on some a while back. And I watch a lot of movies. Also a MSc in High Energy Physics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust programming language. I have bought a Raspberry Pi 4 recently and I'm looking forward to writing some cool project for it in Rust. Stay tuned!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Well, I'm not currently collaborating via GitHub. I use mainly as a mean of backing up my code and making it code available from different machines. Sad but true.
- 📫 How to reach me... Just drop me an email to semkiv@gmail.com.
